# Contributing

I love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the [code of conduct].

[code of conduct]: https://github.com/justmedude/pylotoncycle/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

As this is a side project for me, I may not always be able to get to your
pull request quickly. A few things that will help out the process:

* Please have your changes pass a standard `flake8` run.
* Bias towards python3 compatibility
